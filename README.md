# Data Structures & Algorithms II

This repository is intended for students studying **Algorithms and Data Structures II**, offering a practical approach to manipulating files in secondary memory using the C language. As an example, we developed an application for managing a library.

## Requirements

To successfully implement this project, you need the following technologies and tools configured:

- **Programming Language:** [C] - The project was developed exclusively in C.

- **Database:** [Custom Database] - Uses a custom database stored in binary files in the 'bin' folder.


- **Compiler:** [Minimalist GNU for Windows] - Developed using MinGW as compiler. We recommend [installing](https://terminalroot.com.br/2022/12/como-instalar-gcc-gpp-mingw-no-windows.html) MinGW or GCC to ensure adequate performance and avoid bugs, as the fixes are based on specific compiler commands.

- **Operating System:** [Windows] - Exclusively compatible with Windows due to the use of the *<windows.h>* graphics library.

## Uses

### Common Usage

To get started using the Library Management System, follow these steps:

1. Compile the source code directly via bat (inside the repository directory):

```shell windows 
.\compile.bat
```
2. This will compile all .c files in the directory, then run the main program using the following command:
````shell windows
./window.exe
````
### Own/Modified Use

If you want to make modifications to the project so that it only works via the terminal, I recommend that you follow these steps to avoid bugs:

1. Create your *main* file inside `unit_tests/main.c`;

2. After making all the desired modifications to your program, compile:
```shell windows 
gcc -o main ./src/*.c ... /pasta_x/*.c

```
3. This will compile all .c files in the directories, then run the main program using the following command:
````shell windows
./main.exe
````

4. (You can also change compile.bat to make the repetitive process easier)

**Note** If there are bugs in the compilation, you can delete all window handling files and folders, namely:
- `./windows_main.c`
- `./src/window_functions`

## Source

In this section, we will cover how codes work

Don't worry, in the `./src` folder, you will find everything documented in the headers, happy reading!

#### General observations:

- Each script is independent and contains its own specific windows and functionality.
- Careful handling of files and validation of user input are important considerations, and their implementations are in `/src/estruturas.c`
- Scripts can be compiled separately, and their functionality can be integrated as needed.
